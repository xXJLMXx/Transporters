# TRANSPORTERS 

This is a progressive web app using a samsung template for the front end. 

Progressive web applications (PWAs) are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline for general information and contacts, push notifications, and device hardware access traditionally available only to native applications. 

For the ride sharing functionality of this web app, we are using a web based uber clone template to ensure reliance an scalability. 

All tech in this project is open source and hackable to fit the needs of our local communities with a focus on expansion and scalability.
